# EnhanceMe Splash Page (Next.js)

This is the original splash page for [EnhanceMe](https://www.enhanceme.io), a digital consulting platform that helps individuals present their authentic selves with confidence—starting with dating profiles, but with impact far beyond that.

🌱 **Status:** This is an archived version of our pre-launch placeholder, originally hosted at [enhanceme.io](https://www.enhanceme.io).  
🟢 The current live platform is powered by [Ghost CMS](https://www.ghost.org) and can be accessed at [enhanceme.io](https://www.enhanceme.io).  
🔍 This version remains available at [https://enhanceme-splash-next.vercel.app](https://enhanceme-splash-next.vercel.app) for archival and development reference.
